I began working on my father’s dairy farm in the early 2000s, where we milked approximately 80 cows from 1998 to 2008. I quickly developed a passion for raising young livestock and was proudly recognized as the farm’s “calf raiser.” I raised both heifers and bull calves—caring for bull calves until two months of age, and raising heifers as replacements for our aging cows.

In 2008, I transitioned to Aquila Farms, where I worked until 2017. My responsibilities included assisting with daily milking operations, working in the maternity pen, and—during the last four years—raising heifers from birth to breeding age. I also collaborated closely with veterinarians and nutritionists to ensure the animals received optimal care and management.

In 2010, I purchased my own home, and by 2014 I built a cattle barn on the property. From 2015 to 2021, I successfully raised approximately five steers annually. That number increased to 10 steers in 2022 and 2023, then expanded significantly to 28 steers in 2024. As of 2025, I am now raising 45 steers from birth to 5 months of age.

I currently supply 450 lb. steers to two dedicated customers. One of them has been a mentor to me—raising cattle up to 1,550 lbs. for nearly two decades. His guidance and experience have been invaluable, and I continue to turn to him for insight and advice on cattle management.

🐂 Future Goals & Expansion
My immediate goal is to increase my operation to 60 steers at my current location by the end of the year. Long-term, I plan to build a full-scale operation raising 204 cattle at any given time, following a rotation of purchasing 12 baby calves per month and selling 12 finished steers (1,550 lbs.) per month.

 I am currently exploring the purchase of a farm with existing barns or acquiring nearby land to build new facilities suited for raising cattle at scale.
